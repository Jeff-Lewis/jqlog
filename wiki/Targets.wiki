== Creating your own log target ==

A log target should extend the `jqlog.targetDefaults` object.  This will mean that your target will pick up all the jqlog default settings and any additional ones set by other plugins.

{{{
jQuery.extend({}, jQuery.jqlog.targetDefaults, { name: "target", ... });
}}}

To register your log target with jqlog you just need to add it to the targets array.  The array is indexed by log target name.  

{{{
jQuery.jqlog.targets["target"] = target;
}}}

_Note that the order in which the targets are executed by jqlog is not guaranteed_.
