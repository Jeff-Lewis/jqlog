Defines the log targets provided with jqlog.

== Alert ==

== Console ==

== Creating your own log target ==

A log target should extend the `jqlog.targetDefaults` object.  This will mean that your target will pick up all the jqlog default settings and any additional ones set by other plugins.

{{{
jQuery.extend({}, jQuery.jqlog.targetDefaults, { name: "target", ... });
}}}

To register your log target with jqlog you just need to add it to the targets array.  The array is indexed by log target name.  _Note that the order in which the targets are called is not guaranteed_.

The following alert target is provided with jqlog and just logs messages using the alert box.

{{{
(function($) {
    jQuery.jqlog.targets["alert"] = jQuery.extend({}, jQuery.jqlog.targetDefaults, {
    
        /*
        Target name.
        */
        name: "alert",        
        
        /* 
        Target version.
        */
        version: "1.0",
        
        /*
        Logs a entry using the alert window.
        
        Parameters:
           entry -   The entry to log.
        */        
        log: function (entry) {
            alert(entry.message);
        }
    });
})(jQuery);
}}}
